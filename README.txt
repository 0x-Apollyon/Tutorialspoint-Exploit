A basic exploit in the online code interpreter tutorialspoint 
It moves through the files in the /home/cg/root directory as it stores all the codes ever run using the interpreter
It searches for specific keywords in the files
Some interesting stuff I found using this are also included in the Screenshots folder

[ A similar thing can be implemented with recursion to move over /var/www ;) ]
